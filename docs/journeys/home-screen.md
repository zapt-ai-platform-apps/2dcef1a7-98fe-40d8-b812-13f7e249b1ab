# Home Screen

## Steps

1. Open the Application
   - When you navigate to the root URL, you see the home screen with our main layout.
2. Observe the Layout
   - The screen fills the browser window (using Tailwind's min-h-screen), ensuring a full-height layout.
   - "App Template" content is shown in the main area.
   - A footer with a "Made on ZAPT" badge is shown at the bottom.

Nothing else is required; the home screen is a simple starting point for exploring further features like the Dark Mode toggle.
